What is a server?
A server is a computer or a system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In this case, the server hosts the website and serves it to users who request it.

What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name serves as a human-readable address for a website. It allows users to easily access the website by typing in a memorable name instead of an IP address. In this case, the domain name is "www.foobar.com."

What type of DNS record is "www" in "www.foobar.com"?
The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a subdomain and represents a specific service or resource within the domain. It is typically used to denote the web server for a website. The DNS record associated with it is usually a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the main domain or the IP address of the server.

What is the role of the web server?
The web server, in this case, Nginx, handles incoming HTTP requests from clients (users' computers) and delivers the appropriate responses. It serves static files and can also route requests to the application server for dynamic content generation.

What is the role of the application server?
The application server runs the web application's code base and processes dynamic requests. It communicates with the web server to generate dynamic content and deliver it back to the user. It can execute scripts, access databases, and perform other application-specific tasks.

What is the role of the database?
The database, MySQL in this case, stores and manages the website's data. It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate information required by the application. The application server interacts with the database to perform operations such as storing user data, retrieving content, and processing queries.

What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?
The server communicates with the user's computer over the network using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When the user requests the website, the server receives the HTTP request, processes it, generates a response, and sends it back to the user's computer using the same protocol.

Now let's discuss the issues with this infrastructure:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure): Since this infrastructure relies on a single server, any failure or issue with that server can lead to a complete downtime of the website. If the server crashes, experiences hardware failure, or faces network issues, the website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during maintenance: When performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code or updating server configurations, the web server (Nginx) may need to be restarted. During this downtime, the website won't be available to users, causing potential inconvenience.

Limited scalability: With a single server, this infrastructure may struggle to handle a high volume of incoming traffic. If the website experiences a surge in visitors or traffic, the server's resources might get overwhelmed, resulting in slower response times or even crashes.
